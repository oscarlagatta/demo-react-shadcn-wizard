/**
 * ResourceAlignmentPage - Main component implementing MVP pattern
 *
 * This component orchestrates the Model-View-Presenter architecture:
 * - Model: Handles all data management and business logic
 * - View: Manages UI rendering and user interface components
 * - Presenter: Coordinates user interactions and updates between Model and View
 *
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Clear separation of concerns
 * - Improved testability
 * - Better maintainability
 * - Scalable codebase structure

/**
 * MVP Architecture Documentation
 *
 * MODEL (resource-alignment/model.ts):
 * - Manages all application state and data
 * - Contains business logic and validation rules
 * - Provides methods for data manipulation and retrieval
 * - Handles resource filtering, validation, and calculations
 * - Maintains data integrity and consistency
 *
 * VIEW (resource-alignment/view.tsx):
 * - Handles all UI rendering and presentation logic
 * - Contains reusable UI component methods
 * - Manages visual state and user interface elements
 * - Provides clean separation between UI and business logic
 * - Ensures consistent styling and accessibility
 *
 * PRESENTER (resource-alignment/presenter.ts):
 * - Coordinates between Model and View
 * - Handles all user interactions and events
 * - Manages application flow and navigation
 * - Updates View based on Model changes
 * - Provides clean API for user actions
 *
 * BENEFITS:
 * 1. Separation of Concerns: Each component has a single responsibility
 * 2. Testability: Components can be tested independently
 * 3. Maintainability: Changes to one layer don't affect others
 * 4. Scalability: Easy to extend and modify functionality
 * 5. Reusability: Components can be reused across different contexts
 * 6. Code Organization: Clear structure makes codebase easier to navigate
 *
 * INTEGRATION:
 * - Seamlessly integrates with existing application framework
 * - Maintains all original functionality and features
 * - Follows same design patterns as other application sections
 * - Preserves accessibility, responsiveness, and usability
 * - Uses same random names and data structure
